The posts in this personal micro-blog are snippets from my current and older projects.
The projects are mostly not in the public domain, but the snippets are.

The topics are typically related to edge computing:
* software development for embedded systems
* sensor fusion
* Bluetooth LE
* computer simulation of physical sensors
* control
* neural networks trained in the cloud and deployed at the edge
* computer vision.

I'm adding new snippets gradually when I have free time. I hope you find them interesting!
